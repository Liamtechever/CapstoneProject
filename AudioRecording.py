    """
    Records audio and stops automatically after detecting a long silence **following** speech.

    - Allows **short pauses** in speech (up to `short_pause_duration` sec).
    - Stops recording **immediately** after a long silence (`long_silence_duration`).
    - Ensures the audio stream properly closes after stopping.

    Parameters:
    - filename (str): Name of the output file.
    - samplerate (int): Sample rate of recording.
    - channels (int): Number of audio channels.
    - silence_threshold (float): Volume level below which sound is considered silence.
    - short_pause_duration (float): Max duration of short pauses allowed.
    - long_silence_duration (float): Duration required to detect a long silence and stop.

    Returns:
    - Saves the recorded file and exits.
